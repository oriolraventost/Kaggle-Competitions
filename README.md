# üèÜ Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks from Kaggle competitions, with a focus on the Playground Series.
Each notebook is thoroughly commented to explain the workflow ‚Äî from data exploration and feature engineering to model selection and evaluation.
My goal is to learn data science and machine learning through practice while sharing clear, reproducible solutions.

# üéØ Projects
- [Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts | Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/oriolraventost/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/predict-the-introverts-from-the-extroverts.ipynb) - Built a machine learning model to classify individuals as introverts or extroverts based on behavioral and personality trait data using an XGBoost model with stratified cross-validation, achieving 96.96% accuracy and ranking in the top 5.2% of participants.
- [Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset | Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/oriolraventost/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/binary-classification-with-a-bank-dataset.ipynb) - Developed a model to predict the probability of client subscription to bank term deposits using XGBoost and LightGBM with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and blended predictions, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.97443 and ranking in the top 15.7% of participants.
